        <p> Hi there! My name is Ely Herrera, and I am just about to enroll in a Bootcamp for Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>Before making this decision, I recently became a Certified Personal Trainer and I come from a background in customer service and human resources.</p>
        <p>Growing up in El Paso, Texas I always loved the state but moved to Phoenix, Arizona for college. However, I have found my way back to Texas when I moved to Dallas earlier this year.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My journey up to this point in my life has not gone the way I initially expected. My original plan for life after high school went a little like this: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go straight to college.</li>
            <li>Pick a major that sounds good where I could be successful coming out of College.</li>
            <li>Graduate and begin my career</li>
          </ol>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, it did not turn out how I had planned.  Unfortunately, I ended up dropping out of college and it all resulted from not having a plan and consistently asking myself what I wanted to do for a career. Through my experience and just stumbling my way through life, I finally had an honest conversation with myself about what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>After taking some time and doing research, I found myself interested in the tech space, particularly in Software Engineering. I found that Bootcamps were becoming a viable option to enter the field and here I am now creating my first webpage through the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> Program!</p>
        <p>Many reasons piqued my interest in the field but the main ones are the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leveraging technology to create projects to ultimately help other people in some way or another.</li>
            <li>Working with others to create these types of projects excites me!</li>
            <li>Constantly educating yourself to help you excel in your career.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>One of my interests outside of Software Development is fitness. I mentioned earlier that I had become a Certified Personal Trainer at the beginning of this year. Fitness has always been a constant in my life and I always loved sharing knowledge and helping others live healthier lives in any way, whether it be through nutrition or their movement.</p>
