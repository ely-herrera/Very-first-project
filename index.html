      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Hi there, my name is Ely Herrera. I am just about to enroll into a bootcamp for Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>Prior to making this decision, I have become a Certified Personal Trainer and come from a background of Customer service and Human Resources.</p>
        <p> I grew up in El Paso, TX and I have recently moved from living in Phoenix, AZ to Dallas, TX. </p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My journey up to this point in my life has not gone the way I initially expected, as it goes for mostly everyone I imagine. My original plan to take my life after high school went a little like this: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go straight to college.</li>
            <li>Pick a major that sounds good where I could be successful coming out of College.</li>
            <li>Graduate and begin my career</li>
          </ol>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, it did not turn out how I planned. I actually ended up dropping out of College unfortunately and it all resulted from not having a plan and asking myself what I wanted to do for a career. Through my experience and just stumbling my way through life, I finally had an honest conversation with myself about what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>After taking some time and doing research, I found myself really interested in the tech space, particulary in Software Engineering. I found that bootcamps were becoming a viable option to enter the field and here I am now creating my first webpage through the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> Program!
        <p>There are many reasons that peaked my interest in the field but the main ones are the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leveraging Technology to create projects to ultimately help others in some way or another.</li>
            <li>Working with others to create these types of projects really excites me!</li>
            <li>Constantly educating yourself to help you excel in your career</li>
          </ul>
        <p>One of my interests outside of Software Development is Fitness. I mentioned earlier that I had become a Certified Personal Trainer at the beginning of this year. Fitness has always been a constant in my life and always loved sharing knowledge and helping others live a healthier life in anyway, whether it be through nutrition or through their movement.</p>
